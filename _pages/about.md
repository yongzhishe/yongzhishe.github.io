I'm a first year master student from [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, edge AI systems, and tiny machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qihua Zhou](http://qihuazhou.com/) of PEILab Lab from [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering]([https://cs.pku.edu.cn/](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/)), Shenzhen University.
